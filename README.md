# HandwritingIdentfer
Using the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits [0-9] to train. Opens in python (.py) or Jupyter notebook (.ipynb)

# Input
Inputs 256 x256 images of handwritten digits 0 - 9

# Model
Uses a keras/tensor flow package *Convolutional Neural Network*

Is trained on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, and tested via 15 epochs (the model is trained on the data 15 times)

# Output
The category that the model decides the image belongs to a numeral from: 0 - 9

This model achieved an over **98% accuracy in classification of handwritten digits**
